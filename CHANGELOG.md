# 0.4.0

* Every URL you pass gets loaded twice. First *without Javascript* and then
  *with JavaScript* (and waiting for network to be idle). These means the
  minimal CSS will contain CSS that was necessary **before** the page is fully
  loaded as well.
  Also, the engine has entirely changed. Instead of evaluating the DOM inside
  a page evaluation (the equivalent of running in the Web Console), puppeteer
  is only used to 1) download relevant assets and 2) yield the DOM as a string
  of HTML. Instead [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) is used
  to compare the CSS to the DOM.

  downloading certain URLs. [pull#31](https://github.com/peterbe/minimalcss/pull/31)

[compare](https://github.com/peterbe/minimalcss/compare/v0.1.2...v0.2.0)

  `stdout`. Off by default.

* Upgrade to css-tree 1.0.0-alpha24

* List of "dead obvious" selectors that don't need to be analyzed like
  `*`, `body`, and
`html`.
